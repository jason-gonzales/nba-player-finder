# nba-player-finder
A front-end React.js project where a user can search for his/her favorite NBA player. An interactive basketball card will show an image of the player searched, as well as his information. When a user clicks on the card, it will flip over to the back where a user can search for that player's statistics based on the season that he played in. Below the basketball card is a vintage televison, where a user will be able to see a thumbnail that leads to the players highlight video. User can also log in and log out of the application.
